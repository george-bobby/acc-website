          <h2>Why we need to pray?</h2>
          <p>
            Prayer is a fundamental way to connect with God. 
            It serves as a form of communication, expressing 
            gratitude, seeking guidance, and building a personal 
            connection with their faith. Through prayer, 
            Christians find solace and strength, and follow 
            the teachings of Jesus who himself prayed frequently.

                    that anyone who fled to your protection, implored your help or
                    sought your intercession, was left unaided. Inspired by this
                    confidence, we fly unto you, O Virgin of virgins, my Mother; to you do we
                    come, before you we stand, sinful and sorrowful; O Mother of the
                    Word Incarnate, despise not our petitions, but in your mercy hear
                    and answer them. <br>
                    Amen.
